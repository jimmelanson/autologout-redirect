# autologout-redirect

This JavaScript will redirect a webpage after alerting the user and giving them the option of resetting the counter.
I use this to automatically logout website users that have been idel for a set amount of time. It uses a CSS popup
to give them the option of resetting the timer.

Read my blog post explaining this JS:
